## WHAT IS IT?

CAT-SOOP is a tool for automatic collection and assessment of online exercises, originally developed primarily for use in MIT's 6.01 (Introduction to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science via Robotics).

CAT-SOOP is free/libre software, available under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3+.  Please note that the terms of this license apply to the CAT-SOOP system itself and any plugins in use, but not to any course material hosted on a CAT-SOOP instance, unless explicitly stated otherwise.


## HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

To install, run:

```nohighlight
pip3 setup.py install
```

Or, from a clone of the repository, run:

```nohighlight
python setup.py install
```

#### Configuring

To generate a config.py file, run:

```nohighlight
catsoop configure
```

If you are setting up a public-facing copy of CAT-SOOP (as opposed to a local copy for debugging purposes), see the instructions at https://catsoop.mit.edu/website/docs/server_setup

#### Testing
