def make_all_groups(context, path, section):

    Randomly assigns groups within the given section for the given page,
    overwriting any existing groups for that section and page.

    All users with a file in `__USERS__` who are members of the given section
    are considered.

    Several variables in the given `context` affect the way groups are
    assigned:

    * The students can optionally be separated into subcategories (such that
        each student will only be partnered with other within their
        subcategory) by specifying a function `cs_group_category(path,
        username) => category_name`.

    * The names to be given to the various groups can be specified in
        `cs_group_names`, which should be a list of strings.

    * Within each subcategory, students are randomly shuffled, and groups of
        size `cs_group_size` are made from the shuffled list.  Students will
        _never_ be paired with students outside their subcategory, even is
        `cs_group_size` does not evenly divide the number of students in a
        category.

    **Parameters:**

    * `context`: the context associated with this request
    * `path`: a list of strings representing the path we're interested in
