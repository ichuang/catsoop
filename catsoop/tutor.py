    Helper function to generate the display that users should see for their

    The output depends on a number of constraints:

    If `csq_show_score` is `False`, then no score is displayed.  In this case,
    if the user has submitted something, they will see a message indicating
    that a submission has been received.  Otherwise, they will see nothing.

    If no score is given, the most recent score is looked up (either from the
    manual grading entries log or from the problem state log) and used.

    After determining the score, if a `csq_score_message` function is defined,
    it is called with the current score (a `float` between 0 and 1) passed in
    as its sole argument, and the result is returned.  Otherwise, a default
    value is used.

    Compute statistics about the given user and page.

    This function is designed to provide all the information one could want to
    know about a given page, including both information about the page itself
    and about the given user's activities on the page.

    Exactly what values are computed and included in the result depends on the
    value of the optional parameter `keys`.  If no value is provided, all of
    the following keys are included in the resulting dictionary.  Otherwise,
    only the keys given by `keys` are included.

    Possible keys are:

    * `'context'`: an approximation of the context the user would see if they
        loaded the page, after the entire page load completes (including the
        handler)
    * `'questions'`: an `OrderedDict` mapping question names to tuples, in the
        same order they are specified on the page.  each value is a tuple of
        the form outputted by `catsoop.tutor.question`
    * `'question_info'`: an ordered dictionary mapping question names to
        dictionaries with information about those questions
    * `'state'`: the user's most recent "problemstate" log entry for this page
    * `'actions'`: a list containing all the user's actions on this page
    * `'manual_grades'`: a list containing all manual grading entries for the
        user on this page (i.e., all grades assigned _to them_)

    efficient.  If it is used to inspect the context, it will be a bit slower,
    as it must then simulate the entire process associated with the given user
    loading the given page.

    **Parameters:**

    Initialize the random number generator for per-user, per-page randomness.

    Random seeds are stored in a log.  This function will try to read that log
    to determine the appropriate random seed for this user and page.  If no
    such seed exists, a new random value is generated (from `/dev/urandom` if
    possible).

    This value is then stored as `cs_random_seed` and used to seed the
    `random.Random` instance in `cs_random`.

    This function is called as `tutor.init_random()` in almost all cases; i.e.,
    it is called with no arguments.  A hack in `catsoop.loader.cs_compile` will
    insert the argument.

    **Parameters:**

    * `context`: the context associated with this request

    **Returns:** `None`
