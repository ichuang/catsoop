    Create a function that can be used to set the signal that the calling
    process receives when its parent process dies (not supported on Mac OSX).

    This is used when starting new processes to try to make sure they die if
    CAT-SOOP is killed.

    **Optional Parameters:**

    * `sig` (default `signal.SIGTERM`): the signal to be sent to this process
        when its parent dies

    **Returns:** a function of no arguments that, when called, sets the parent
    process death signal of the calling process to the value given by `sig`.
    On Mac OSX, instead returns a function of no arguments that does nothing
    when called.
