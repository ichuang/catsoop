# Current Developments #
########################

Work toward next release.  Currently under development.

ADDED:

* Added "Log In" / "Log Out" to top menu by default, and gave authentication
  types the ability to populate that menu.

CHANGED:

* Separated WSGI server into separate process, and allow cs_wsgi_server_port to
  be a list to start multiple servers (for load balancing).

* Updated wsgi.py so that it can be used by an external WSGI server (such as
  uWSGI).

DEPRECATED:

REMOVED:

FIXED:

* Added CSS to prevent scrollbars from appearing on the CAT-SOOP logo in page
  footers.

* Fixed key generation for AES encryption in login authentication mode.

* Fixed a bug with changing password in login authentication mode.

* Fixed a bug with client-side password hashing so that the hash is now a
  proper PBDKF2 hash of the given password.

SECURITY:

DOCUMENTATION:


##################
# Version 11.1.1 #
##################

ADDED:

* Added the 'legacy' grading mode, which does not use the asynchronous checker.

CHANGED:

* Separated checker results into subdirectories to prevent a single directory
  growing too large.

* Helper scripts are now launched using sys.executable, rather than a
  hard-coded "python3".

* Checks run through the asynchronous checker now cache their results in the
  problemstate directory, to avoid having to do a double-lookup.

* Attempts at improved error reporting throughout CAT-SOOP.

REMOVED:

* Removed the PKiller class, which is no longer used anywhere.

FIXED:

* Temporary workaround for automatic scrolling to location of anchor.

* Fixed a bug with username/password-based access to the get_user_information
  API endpoint.

* Fixed a bug with the name of uploaded files.

SECURITY:

* The current session ID and API token are now filtered from error messages.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added (hopefully) meaningful docstrings to almost everything in the codebase.


##################
# Version 11.1.0 #
##################

ADDED:

* Added cheroot (https://github.com/cherrypy/cheroot) as a catsoop.tools
  package.

* Added websockets (https://github.com/aaugustin/websockets) as a catsoop.tools
  package.

CHANGED:

* cheroot is now used instead of uWSGI.

* File names for uploaded files now include the csq_name of the question they
  were uploaded for.

FIXED:

* Fixed an issue whereby the Python sandbox could leave handles to deleted
  files open (eventually leading to an error from having too many files open).

* Changed the Python sandbox to use sys.executable (instead of hard-coded path
  to an assumed location of a Python interpreter) when csq_python_interpreter is
  not set.

SECURITY:

* File names for uploaded files now include a hash of their contents to limit
  the feasibility of a brute-force attack to grab a different user's files.


##################
# Version 11.0.5 #
##################

ADDED:

* Added the get_upload utility for downloading uploaded files.

* Added "extra_data" field to checker results.

* Added tutor.read_checker_result for quickly reading checker results.

* Added csq_npoints as an option to the "pythoncode" question type.  If
  specified, it overrides any point values assigned to the individual test
  cases.

CHANGED:

* Changed the default checker used for multiple-choice-multiple-answer problems.

* The "fileupload" question type now uses get_upload to download user files,
  rather than a data URI.

* Made changes to make sure that files are always closed after being opened.

FIXED:

* Fixed a potential race condition in the "pythoncode" question type.

* Fixed an issue with the "expression" question type, where overzealous type
  checking led to some correct answers being marked as incorrect.

* Fixed issues with the circuit simulator question type that prevented an AC
  analysis from being run interactively, and that caused incorrect AC results
  to be sent to the checker.

* Changes to make sure that reasonable fonts are used (particularly in <pre>,
  <code>, and <tt>) even if our fonts are not loaded.

* Some small temporary fixes to AC analysis in the circuit simulator for the
  "circuit" question type.

SECURITY:

* Fixed an issue whereby get_upload could be used to read arbitrary files from
  disk via a carefully constructed request.

  websocket connection.

* The checker and reporter are now two separate processes.

FIXED:

* Fixed serious bug (deadlock) with checker script / logging.

#################
# Version 9.0.0 #
#################

ADDED:

  * Added back the catsoopdb format (last seen in version 4.0.1), with
    improvements to prevent collisions and a few bugfixes.

  * Added Beautiful Soup to the distribution.
    (https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

  * Included Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) in the distribution, and
    updated the default theme to use it (also moved main.template and base.css
    to old.template and old.css, respectively, to make room for new style).

  * Added the cs_base_color variable, for switching the main color of the
    default theme.

  * Added syntax highlighting to code blocks, via highlight.js.
    (https://highlightjs.org/).  If no language is explicitly specified for
    syntax highlighting, the value stored in cs_default_code_language will be
    used (default is no syntax highlighting; explicitly setting that value to
    None will cause highlight.js to guess the appropriate language for each
    block).

  * Added support for authentication via OpenID Connect.
    (http://openid.net/connect/)

  * Added support for default courses via cs_default_course.

  * Added the list_questions and get_state API endpoints to the default
    handler.

  * Added an easier way to spoof context loading with loader.spoof_early_load.

  * Added cslog.modify_most_recent, which updates the most recent log entry
    atomically.

  * Added method for sending e-mail to a CAT-SOOP user from the API without
    knowing their e-mail address.

  * Added support for input checks and ratio checking (rather than absolute
    error checking) to the expression question type.

  * Added number question type for single numbers (or simple fractions).

  * Added __PLUGINS__ directory for plugins which work in ways other than
    defining a new QTYPE or handler (ability to affect the context before or
    after preload, before or after content load, and after handler is invoked).

CHANGED:

  * CAT-SOOP is now only compatible with Python version 3.5+.  Python 2
    compatibility was dropped intentionally, but versions 3.0.0 <= x < 3.5 are
    not supported because CAT-SOOP does some strange things with imports.

  * CAT-SOOP no longer runs on Windows hosts.

  * Drastically improved inheritance for question types (requiring far less
    manual work) via tutor.qtype_inherit.

  * CAT-SOOP XML parsing is now largely handled by Beautiful Soup instead of by
    regular expressions.

  * Renamed gb.py -> base_context.py to more accurately reflect its usage.

  * Modified the login authentication type to use Python's built-in
    implementation of PBKDF2.

  * Changed the way authentication is handled in AJAX requests, in preparation
    for including the public-facing API.

  * Themes are now run through a pre-processor that handles <python> and
    <printf> tags (including @{...} syntax).

  * Passwords (in all forms) are now hashed both before and after being sent to
    the server (passwords are now never sent in plain-text).

  * Navigation links should now be held in cs_top_menu instead of
    cs_navigation.

  * <ref> tags can now take the relevant label as label="x" in addition to just
    as x.

  * Improved error pages shown on 404 File Not Found.

  * Default permissions now include the 'view' permission.

  * Modified the default "loading" spinner to use CSS instead of an image

  * csq_check_function can now return a dictionary mapping 'score' to the score
    and 'msg' to a message to be returned, eliminating the need for
    csq_msg_function when it is more convenent to compute the score and message
    at the same time.  Alternatively, it can return a tuple (score, message).
    The old form is still supported.

  * csq_msg_function, if used, can now optionally take a second argument
    representing the solution (the message doe not need to be computed from the
    submission alone).

  * Replaced "response" field with "message" in JSON returned by the default
    handler's AJAX calls, to avoid duplicate use of "response".

  * The CAT-SOOP cat changes when displaying a 404 or 500 error message.

  * Improved error reporting in pythonic question type.

FIXED:

  * Tracebacks in CAT-SOOP error messages now actually show useful information.

  * Pre-compiled CAT-SOOP (.pycs) files' names now include the Python
    implementation's cache tag, so that the same course can be migrated to a
    CAT-SOOP instance running on a different version of Python without issue.

  * Fixed a bug whereby an empty entry in a multiplechoice question (--) was
    interpreted as being the last element in the csq_options list.

  * Missing files/directories are now always handled as 404 errors, rather than
    500.

  * Fixed a bug resulting from a nonexistent courses directory.

  * The cs_post_load hook is now invoked at a time when cs_content is still
    relevant.

  * Fixed bug with expression question type erroring when using multiple values
    for a variable.

  * Prevented PLY from writing its parsing tables to disk.

SECURITY:

  * Included the option to tune the number of iterations used with PBKDF2, and
    increased the default number of iterations from 50,000 to 250,000.

  * Minimum password length in the login authentication type is now 8 instead
    of 5 (per the NIST recommendation at:
    https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html


#################
# Version 8.0.0 #
#################

ADDED:

  * <label> and <ref> tags are now available, for easier referencing of
    sections within a CAT-SOOP page.

  * Answers and explanations can now be automatically viewed in certain
    situations (running out of submissions, earning 100% score).

  * Added a check for non-ASCII characters in input, and an error message to be
    displayed in this case.

  * Most CAT-SOOP options related to the default handler can now be specified
    as functions that return the appropriate value, rather than the value
    itself, which allows them to be set in a way that depends on the current
    context.

  * Added a way to compute stats about a particular page (for use in making
    gradebooks).

  * Question types can now have multiple form fields by having names starting
    with __QNAME_, where QNAME is the name of the question.

  * The multiplechoice question type has two new modes which allow for
    arbitrary formatting (including math) in the options: checkbox, which
    allows multiple answers to be selected; and radio, which allows only one
    answer to be selected.

  * Added the cs_debug function, which can be used to log arbitrary information
    to a file during execution of a preload or content file.

  * Resources can now be loaded from arbitrarily-named files (e.g.,
    <root>/path/to/foo.md instead of <root>/path/to/foo/content.md)

  * In the pythoncode question type, it is now possible to hide the code
    associated with test cases.

  * Added data_uri module from https://gist.github.com/zacharyvoase/5538178
    for better handling of file uploads

  * Users can now log in with their e-mail addresses instead of their usernames
    when using the login authentication type.

  * Permissions can now be specified directly via cs_permissions, instead of
    exclusively via roles.

  * The pythoncode question type can now handle Python 3 code.

  * Handlers and question types can now have viewable pages inside them,
    viewable at <url_root>/__HANDLER__/default/page_name

  * Every page footer now links to both the terms of the license, and also to
    the "download source" link.

  * Added a module for sending e-mails, primarily for use in the login
    authentication type.

  * MathJax https://www.mathjax.org/ is now included directly, rather than
    loaded from their CDN.

CHANGED:

  * Functions inside of question types no longer need to manually load default
    values; values from the defaults variable are automatically used when not
    specified inside the <question> tag.

    and to customize the types of e-mail addresses that are accepted.

  * Improved error reporting in the login auth type.

#################

FIXED:

  * Fixed a syntax error in the expression question type.


#################
# Version 7.0.0 #
#################

ADDED:

  * Included KaTeX (https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/).

    string), and for automatic streaming of large static files.

  * Added support for inline (runnable by users) test cases in pythoncode
    question types.

    the server) for synchronization purposes; source.zip, which downloads a zip
    archive containing the CAT-SOOP source code; and license, which contains
    the text of CAT-SOOP's license.

  * Added a string mode to the pythonic question type, which allows the answer
    to be specified as a string to be evaluated.  Also added the csq_code_pre
    variable to this question type, for setting up the environment into which
    csq_soln will be evaluated in string mode.

CHANGED:

  * Math rendering now uses KaTeX (fast, but limited support) when possible,
    and falls back to MathJax (slow, but more support) when necessary.

  * "Special" CAT-SOOP variables are now prefixed with cs_ (for page-specific

    but requires that the submission be a literal value (rather than the result
    of a more complicated expression).

CHANGED:

  * Modified handling of footnotes.

  * File containing user information should now end in .py (e.g., username.py
    instead of username).

  * Reorganized python... question types to properly inherit from one another
    to avoid duplicate code.

REMOVED:

  * The problem activity type was removed, in favor of ajaxproblem.

    submitting at the end of a timed exercise.

  * Added the handout activity type, which allows for showing a static file,
    but with access controls (releasing after a particular date, only viewable
    by particular role, etc).

  * Added support for displaying explanations in addition to answers in
    particular question types.

CHANGED:

  * Logs are now stored in SQLite (https://www.sqlite.org/) databases.

  * The logo in the main page is now displayed as text, rather than as an

  * Added the ajaxproblem activity type, which allows submitting individual
    questions without reloading the entire page.  Made ajaxproblem the default
    activity type.

  * Added support for skipping ahead or behind by weeks in relative
    timestrings, using + or - (e.g., M+:17:00 means _next_ Monday at 5pm).

  * Solutions for individual students are now displayed when impersonating
    them.

  * Source for pages is now cached in a marshaled format, to prevent having to
    re-parse the source of pages that have not changed.

  * Added support for authenticating via login (username and password) rather
    than via client certificate.

#################

ADDED:

  * problem activities now store due dates, to account for changes in due date
    after submitting.

  * Added support for the ACE code editor (https://ace.c9.io/#nav=about)in
    Python code questions.

CHANGED:

  * Separated loading from METADATA.py into EARLY_LOAD.py and LATE_LOAD.py.
    EARLY_LOAD files are executed all the way down the source tree (for the
    sake of inheritance, as with METADATA.py), but only the LATE_LOAD.py
    associated with the leaf node is executed (to allow some code execution to
    be avoided when working down the tree).
